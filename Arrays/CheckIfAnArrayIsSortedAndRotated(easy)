**crux logic** :
if an array is sorted and rotated as asked, there will be only one or zero points where a number is greater than the number after it. If there are more than 1 points as such, then the array isn't sorted and rotated. 
If that point happens to be at the end of the array, using a modulo of its length will compare it with the first element. If it is elsewhere, it is like normal side4 by sidfe comparison of two consecutive elements.

Main point is the - there will be either 0 or 1 points where one element will be greater than the next.
